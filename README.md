# Slow-Books

This is my final project for TE 566 - Finance for Engineering Management. "Slow Books" is an accounting software of my own making for my future hypothetical small business that I start. It can be used to keep track of employee data, payroll with tax withholdings, vendors, purchase orders, customers, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and inventory.

This is built with Django. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install dependencies.
Run the webapp with "python manage.py runserver"
